This simple perl script allows to pull the Bayoteers extension into an existing bugzilla instance(3.6.x and 4.0.x branches).
It doesn't pull the Metrics or MetricsManager since these are standalone and need to be installed separately.
You can easily customize the extensions you want to install by adding/removing them at line 9:
my @extensions = ('BayotBase','Dashboard','EnhancedTreeView','ADD YOUR EXTENSION HERE');

Note that you can directly use our LandFill repository to test against bugzilla 4.0.4

Have fun ;)
